        <h3>TRIBUTE TO DOCTORS WHO DIED FROM COVID-19</h3>

        <h2>~Yassin Abdel-Warith</h2>
        <h4>Epidemiologist and public health specialist. He was born on Sept 26, 1947, in a village in Yemen's Taiz governorate, and died on June 16, 2020, in Sana'a, Yemen, aged 72 years.</h4>

        <p>
            Yassin Abdel-Warith was involved in the response to major disease outbreaks across Yemen for nearly 50 years. It was no surprise, then, that WHO brought him in as a consultant to help when COVID-19 emerged in Yemen. Despite the ongoing conflict in the country, Abdel-Warith immediately got to work organising surveillance teams and setting up isolation centres.
            His death from COVID-19 robbed Yemen not only of a leader in the response, but also of someone with an unparalleled epidemiological understanding of the country. “From the first day he returned to Yemen after he got his medical degree until the last day he died, he dedicated his life for the health of the Yemeni”, said Adel Al-Jasari, the Malaria and Vector Control Officer for the WHO Country Office in Yemen.

            Abdel-Warith received a degree in medicine and surgery from a Soviet Union university in 1974 and a master's degree in public health and epidemiology from the University of Tehran in Iran in 1978. On his return to Yemen, he was one of the only doctors with a specialisation in public health in the country. “He was really a reference person for all of us”, said Al-Jasari, who worked as the head of the Ministry of Health's malaria control programme in 2004. Although Abdel-Warith was assigned to work as a monitoring and evaluation officer on HIV at the time, “when we called him or asked him to join our team or to support us, he never said no”, said Al-Jasari

        <h2>~Arpik Asratyan</h2>
        <h4>Epidemiologist who specialised in viral hepatitis. She was born on June 25, 1950, in Armenia, and died on March 27, 2020, in Moscow, Russia, aged 69 years.</h4>

        <p>
            Arpik Asratyan joined the Department of Epidemiology and Modern Vaccination Technologies at what is now I M Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University at a crucial moment in 1997. An expert in viral hepatitis, her arrival coincided with “a period at the turn of the century when the problem of parenteral viral hepatitis was especially urgent both in Russia and in the world”, said her colleague Elena Gennadievna Simonova, a Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Modern Vaccination Technologies.

        <p>
            Asratyan developed her interest in epidemiology and infectious diseases during her final years at Yerevan State Medical University in Yerevan, Armenia, according to her son, Airazat Kazaryan, a Professor of Surgery in the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery at Østfold Hospital Trust in Gralum, Norway. When a PhD fellowship position was announced in 1973 at what is now the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow, “she applied to it without doubts”, he said. She would remain there for much of her career. Asratyan pursued a doctorate in medical sciences from the Department of Epidemiology of the Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education in 1977 and earned her professorship at the First Moscow State Medical University following her 1997 defence of her habilitation thesis.

        <h2>~Jitendra Nath Pande</h2>
        <h4>Pulmonologist and former head of the Department of Medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Science. Born on June 14, 1941, in Shikohabad, India, he died on May 23, 2020, in New Delhi, India, aged 78 years.</h4>

        <p>
            Although he was a legendary pulmonologist, called upon to treat presidents and Bollywood stars, Jitendra Nath Pande made time for everyone. His office door was open to colleagues, students, and, especially, patients. “He gave a lot of time to patients”, said Abhishek Bhartia, the Director of the Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Science and Research in New Delhi, India, where Pande worked later in his career. “He was meticulous and he would never rush patients.” Instead, Pande used to frequently remind his students that patients were their best teachers.

        <p>
            Pande was thorough in all aspects of his work. Early in his career on the faculty of the Department of Medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), he was known for being among the first to arrive to the ward each morning, a practice he maintained even after he became the head of the department. And as a professor, he was famous for answering student queries from memory with the page number in the textbook where they could find the information. “Junior doctors used to wait for his ward rounds, which were a treat to attend”, said Amarinder Singh Malhi, Assistant Professor in AIIMS's Department of Cardiovascular Radiology and Endovascular Interventions.
